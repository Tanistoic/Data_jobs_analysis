# üìä Data Analyst Job Market Analysis ‚Äì India

## üß† Introduction
This project dives deep into the Indian job market to understand the landscape for data analysts. It explores job postings to identify high-paying opportunities, essential skills, and trends that can help aspiring and current data analysts align their career paths strategically.

## üèóÔ∏è Background
In a booming digital economy like India, data analytics is one of the most in-demand fields. Yet, many job seekers remain unsure about which skills to focus on or which companies offer the most lucrative roles. This project aims to decode such uncertainties using real job market data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools I Used
SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.

Visual Studio Code: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

## üìà The Analysis
I explored the following key questions through SQL queries:

‚Üí Mapped job IDs to required skills to find out what top jobs demand.
```sql
with top_paying_jobs as (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        name as company_name,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_country = 'India' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### From the analysis of top-paying roles, these skills stood out:

SQL and Python: Most in-demand core skills.

Power BI, Tableau, Excel: Essential for reporting and dashboards.

AWS, Azure, Snowflake, Spark: High-paying roles favour cloud and big data tools.

MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL: Database versatility is key.

Tools like Airflow, Jenkins, GitLab, and Linux show the value of data engineering & automation knowledge.


### 3. Most in-demand skills
‚Üí Counted skill frequency across all job listings to reveal the top 5.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_country = 'India' 
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
